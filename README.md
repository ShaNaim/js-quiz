## Project Scripts

[](#project-scripts)

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm run dev`: **Run the project in development environment with features like hot module replacement.**
- `npm run start` : **Run the Next.** **js server in production mode after the build process is completed.**
- `npm run build` : **Create an optimized production build.**
- `npm run lint` : **Triggers the linter configured for the project (ESLint).**
